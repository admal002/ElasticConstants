This test driver (TD) computes the first strain gradient elasticity (SGE) tensor for simple crystals at an equilibrium lattice spacing dictated by the model. The current version (v1.0) is limited to FCC and BCC crystal structures. The TD computes the SGE tensor for a crystal with equilibrium lattice spacing corresponding to the model coupled to the test using this TD. In other words, this TD depends on a test that computes equilibrium lattice spacing.

The user specifies the following variables through stdin using a Jinja template file named 'pipeline.stdin.tpl' contained in the directory of a Test which uses this TD (the sequence in which they are specified must be the same as below):

- 'path'
Type: string
Description: The path to the TD executable.

- 'testname'
Type: string
Description: The name of the test using this TD.

- 'modelname'
Type: string
Description: The name of the model coupled to a test using this TD

- 'crystalstructure'
Type: string
Description: The type of cubic lattice. In the current version, this string is either 'fcc' or 'bcc'.

- 'dependenttestname'
Type: string
Description: The name of the test that computes the equilibrium lattice spacing for the given crystal structure and model. 

- 'latticespacing'
Type: double
Description: The equilibrium lattice spacing obtained from the results of the test 'dependenttestname' coupled to the model 'modelname'.

- 'Species'
Type: scalar
Description: The species of interest.

************************ Background on strain gradient elasticity*********************

The first strain gradient elasticity tensor D_ijmkln is a sixth-order tensor defined as the second derivative of the strain energy density with respect to strain gradient. D_ijmkln has the following symmetries:

D_ijmkln = D_jimkln,    D_ijmkln = D_ijmlkn,    D_ijmkln = D_klnijm.

Due to the above described symmetries, D consists of 171 independent constants.

As suggested in [1], we use the following Voigt-like representations for the strain gradient elasticity tensor D, and the third-order strain gradient tensor E. D is represented as a 18x18 symmetric matrix d, and E (which has 18 independent variables due to the symmetry E_ijm = E_jim) is presented as a 18x1 column matrix e. The representation e is defined as

     e = (E_111    E_221    2 E_122    E_331    2 E_133
          E_222    E_112    2 E_121    E_332    2 E_233        ------------> (1)
          E_333    E_113    2 E_131    E_223    2 E_232    
          2 E_123  2 E_132  2 E_231)^T

Using (1), any component of D can be obtained from d. For instance, D_112123 is given by

D_112123 = d(7,16) 

since the triads 112 and 123 occur at 7th and 16th position in the representation e defined in (1). 

For cubic materials, it can be shown that there are only 11 independent constants in D. See [1] for a group-theoretic analysis of the strain gradient elasticity tensor for various material groups. Moreover, for cubic materials, d reduces to the following block-diagonal form:
         __              __
         | A9  0   0    0  |
     d = |     A9  0    0  |,                               ----------->  (2)
         |         A9   0  |
         |_            J2 _|

where A9 and J2 are 5x5 and 3x3 symmetric matrices respectively given by

         __                 __  
        | a1  a4  a5  a4  a5  |            __          _
        |     a2  a6  a7  a8  |           | j1  j2  j2  |
  A9 =  |         a3  a8  a9  |,     J2 = |     j1  j2  |,
        |             a2  a6  |           |__       j1 _|
        |__               a3 _|

where {a1,...,a9,j1,j2}  are the 11 independent constants of the cubic material.  From (1) and (2) it follows that the 11 independent elastic components of D for a cubic material are given by 

d(1,1), d(2,2), d(3,3), d(1,2), d(1,3), d(2,3), d(2,4), d(2,5), d(3,4), d(16,16), d(16,17).
